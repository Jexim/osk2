    <p class="lead">JSC USC - the largest shipbuilding company in Russia</p>

    <p>The United Shipbuilding Corporation is an open joint stock company established on March 21, 2007 in accordance with Russian President Vladimir Putin's Decree # 394. 100% of its shares are publicly owned.</p>

    <p>The Corporation is the largest shipbuilding company in Russia employing over 80,000 people. It includes more than 60 domestic shipyards, design offices and ship repair yards. USC’s enterprises operate in all major port and transportation hubs of the country - from Kaliningrad in the west to Vladivostok in the east and from Severodvinsk in the north to Astrakhan in the south.</p>

    <p>USC has consolidated over 80% of design and production capacities of the industry and is the leader in shipbuilding across the area stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

    <p>USC’s design offices are responsible for almost all warships that are built and developed for the Russian Navy and foreign customers. Moreover, our naval materiel and weapons are traditionally distinguished by high reliability combined with combat efficiency, easy maintenance and low cost operation.</p>

    <p>Along with implementing state defense order for the Russian Navy and export orders under MTC agreements, the Corporation builds a modern fleet for operations at sea, in offshore and inland waterways.</p>

    <p>At the same time, meeting local companies’ demands for icebreakers, transport, research, rescue and auxiliary vessels, as well as a wide range of marine equipment for continental shelf development is the largest industrial challenge facing USC in civil shipbuilding.</p>

    <p>Shaping our export policy, we focus on the areas of international cooperation that encompass the entire lifecycle of naval products: market research, specifications preparation, design, production planning, manufacturing, delivery, operation and disposal.</p>

    <p>We are the shipbuilding professionals with unique experience of successful Arctic development, construction and support of one of the most capable fleets in the world.</p>
